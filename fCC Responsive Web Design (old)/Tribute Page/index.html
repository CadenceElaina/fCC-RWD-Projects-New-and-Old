            <p id="tribute-info"> Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American whistleblower who copied and
                leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 when he was a
                Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global
                surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation
                of telecommunication companies and European governments, and prompted a cultural discussion about
                national security and individual privacy. Wikipedia contributors.
